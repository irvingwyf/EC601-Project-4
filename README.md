# EC601-Project-4
For reviewing Zachary Bachrach's codes, I have found some issues and I have raised the issues under his github directory,\
here is the link: https://github.com/zb8787/Product-Design

The screenshots for the issues I raised and his response(if responded) are uploaded as png pictures under this directory.

For unit tests and action tests for project 2's code, I have to put all codes into one script for tweet APIs and the same as\
for Google NLP. So I rewrote and summarized the codes for all codes that I had implemented successfully during project 2.
And the test scripts are also there.
