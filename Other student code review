What I like about Zachery's code is that his codes is simple and staight forward, so it can be easily understand and reproduce.
But this also lead to the thing I don't like, which is that his codes are not adding any innovative perspectives or creating new use of them,

I think he can try to think of some more creative ideas about how to implement the existing APIs and recombine rgem to get new usage of them

and aiming for some existing needs and provide his own solutions for the issue he thought for.
